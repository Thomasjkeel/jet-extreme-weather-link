- **climate_indices** - Climate indices data are from the NOAA Physical Science Library
- **geopotential** - Data from ERA-5 hourly pressure-levels.
- **jet_stream** - [jsmetrics](https://github.com/Thomasjkeel/jsmetrics) was used to compute the jet events algorithm from Koch et al. (2006). jsmetrics was also used with the [jsmetrics-analysis-runner](https://github.com/Thomasjkeel/jsmetrics-analysis-runner) for JASMIN to compute jet latitude and jet speed from Zappa et al. (2018). Data from ERA-5 hourly pressure-levels.
